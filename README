Analysing result of command 'strace WhatIDo 0' (with argument 0):
-------------------------------------------------------------
open("Welcome/To/OS2018", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666) = 3

This command uses the open() sys-ca;;
it opens the file OS2018  in folder 'Welcome/To with flags of
'write' and 'create' and with O_trunc which will truncate file to 0 length.
'= 3' means the function returned FILE DESCRIPTOR is 3. In case of failure
we will have =-1, so this is not a failure.
--------------------------------------------------------------
fstat(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=0, ...}) = 0

This command uses the fstat() sys-call:
Which returns information about the 'os2018' file,
it returned 0 means the sys-call completed successfully.
--------------------------------------------------------------
write(3, "kotek\nIf you haven't read the co"..., 74) = 74

Program calls write sys-call and tries to write 74 characters to OS2018 file,
about the course guidelines, and it did succeed (we can see by the
descriptor id that has been returned != -1).
--------------------------------------------------------------
close(3)                                = 0

This system call succeed closing the file,
as return value is 0.
--------------------------------------------------------------
unlink("Welcome/To/OS2018")             = 0

This sys-call deleted the file OS2018 from the file system.
this call also succeeded.
--------------------------------------------------------------
rmdir("Welcome/To/")                    = 0
rmdir("Welcome/")                       = 0

Both sys-calls deletes given directories (Welcome and To) and succeed.
--------------------------------------------------------------
exit_group(0)                           = ?
+++ exited with 0 +++

This sys-call exit all threads in the process and terminates them.
We can see that it has succeeded.
